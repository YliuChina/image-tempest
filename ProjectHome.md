The goal of **Tempest** is to provide a consistent, reliable, multi-language API for generating heat-map images based on coordinate data-sets.

Tempest consists of separate implementations in multiple programming languages (such as _Perl_, _PHP_, _Python_, et cetera) all conforming to a unified API specification.  Each implementation can alternatively support any number of different image manipulation libraries (such as _GD_, _ImageMagick_, _PIL_).

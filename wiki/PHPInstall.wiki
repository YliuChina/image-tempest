= Introduction =

Tempest for PHP supports installation as a PEAR package, either from a remote PEAR channel or from a local archive file.  It can also be installed manually.

----

== Channel PEAR Install ==

*Note:* These commands may have to be run with administrator priviledges.  On a `*`nix system, this means they must be `sudo`-ed or executed as root.

This will add the channel to your PEAR install.  This must only be done once.
{{{
pear channel-discover pear.digitalflophouse.com
}}}

This will install the latest (bleeding-edge) package.
{{{
pear install digitalflophouse/Tempest-alpha
}}}

Upgrading to a new version is equally simple.
{{{
pear upgrade digitalflophouse/Tempest-alpha
}}}


== Local PEAR Install ==

Assuming you have downloaded the PEAR package to your local filesystem, you can install it via PEAR supplying the file location.
{{{
pear install /home/jdoe/path/to/Tempest-xxxx.yy.zz.tgz
}}}


== Manual Install ==

Manual installation is equally simple.  Extract the archive, and copy the appropriate files to a location within your PHP include path.
{{{
tar -xvzf Tempest-xxxx.yy.zz.tgz
cp Tempest-xxxx.yy.zz/* /home/jdoe/php/include/path/
}}}
